= Word stock

Tool for extracting data for words from Wiktionary dumps.
The idea is to create somewhat language independent tool for parsing this data, because there is very few available datasets for non-very-popular languages, like Czech.

== Current status

I need the data for Czech words for a school project.
At the moment, Czech parser is hardcoded.

== TODO

* Make parsers modular and implement one for English.
